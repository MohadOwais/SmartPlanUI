      "A house is made of bricks and beams. A home is made of hopes and dreams.",
      "Home is the starting place of love, hope, and dreams.",
      "The magic thing about home is that it feels good to leave, and it feels even better to come back.",
      "Home is where love resides, memories are created, friends always belong, and laughter never ends.",
      "A home is not a place, it’s a feeling.",
      "There is nothing more important than a good, safe, and secure home.",
      "Where we love is home—home that our feet may leave, but not our hearts.",
      "The ache for home lives in all of us, the safe place where we can go as we are and not be questioned."
